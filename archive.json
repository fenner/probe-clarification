It would be clearer if the referenced YANG module names were used throughout.\r\n\r\nThat is, in Section 4, replace ifName with name and ifIndex with if-index (these match the referred RFC).  And in Section 7 (if it stays in the final document), replace ifName with name.",

While IPv4, IPv6, and MAC can be found in these tables, other AFIs may not be.  As such, I think the text should be limited to AFIs for IPv4, IPv6, and 48-bit MAC alone.  Any other AFI would result in a malformed message as the lookup cannot be performed.  \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if other lookups could be supported, that could be described here or simply left for other extension documents that might update this document.",

[Section 4.1](https://fenner.github.io/probe-clarification/draft-fenner-intarea-probe-clarification.html#name-code-field-processing) says:\r\n\r\n> The Code field MUST be set to (3) No Such Table Entry if the L-bit\r\n> is clear and the address found in the Interface Identification Object\r\n> does not appear in the IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table or\r\n> the IPv6 Neighbor Cache.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, this is sufficient - if you set the AF to IPX, and that IPX address doesn't appear in the IPv4 ARP or IPv6 neighbor cache (hint: it can't), then you return No Such Table Entry - so we have a well defined behavior in the \"arbitrary AF\" case.\r\n\r\nIf we try to go down the path of limiting this in the address field specification, we end up having to differentiate based on the setting of the L bit - since it's actually valid to ask about the interface with IPX address foo if L=1.\r\n",
